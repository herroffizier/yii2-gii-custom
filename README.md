# Gii Custom

Gii custom is a small collection of generators for personal use. This package should not be considered as stable!

## Installation

Install collection via Composer:

```bash
composer require "herroffizier/yii2-gii-custom:@stable"
```

Extend your Gii config:

```php
[
    'class' => 'yii\gii\Module',
    // ...
    'generators' => [
        // Add generators:
        'baseModel' => [
            'class' => 'herroffizier\gii\model\Generator',
        ],
        'simplifiedCrud' => [
            'class' => 'herroffizier\gii\crud\Generator',
        ],
    ],
]
```

## Generators

### Base + User Model Generator

Generator creates base and user models for specified table. Base model should be never touched so it can be easily regenerated when needed (for example, when new relations added). User model is a place for your code. It extends from base model and contains no autogenerated code.

### Simplified CRUD Generator

Based on default CRUD generator Simplified CRUD Generator skips view and search pages. Also it includes some minor changes in code like merging behaviors with parent.
